# 🁬 MiniBum JS

**MiniBum** is a lightweight, signal-based DOM micro-library designed for rapid UI prototyping, and exploration of reactive state management. It consists of two parts:

- [`minibum/core`](./docs/core/README.md): Low-level, class-based reactivity and DOM bindings
- [`minibum`](./docs/wrapper/README.md): A user-friendly wrapper with sugar syntax for easier UI creation

> 🎓 **Experimental Project:** MiniBum explores reactivity, state management, and DOM rendering(client) from the ground up. Free to use, extend, and learn from.

> ⚠️ This project is `experimental` and MIT licensed. Feel free to use, modify, and learn from it!

## 🧠 Motivation

I created MiniBum as a personal experiment to explore how reactive UIs can be built from scratch using only native DOM and JavaScript.

Most frontend frameworks offer powerful abstractions — but I wanted to see how far I could go with:

- 💡 Simplicity over complexity
- 🔬 Fine-grained reactivity without virtual DOM
- 🎓 A tool that's easy to read, learn from, and hack on

While MiniBum isn't meant to replace full-featured frameworks, it serves as a minimal playground for learning, tinkering, and building tiny interactive widgets.

## Installation

```bash
npm install minibum@experimental
```

## Highlights

- ⚡ Tiny, dependency-free
- 🪡 Fine-grained reactivity—control
- 📆 Built-in signals and subscriptions
- 🧹 Dynamic DOM generation
- ⟳ Reactive lists and conditionals
- 🁬 Designed with simplicity and learning in mind
